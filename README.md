### **What is a Kanban Project Management Tool?**

Kanban is a visual method for managing workflows and projects. Originally developed in the automotive industry, Kanban has become a popular method in project management, especially in software development and other knowledge work areas.

### **Basic Principles of Kanban:**

1. **Visualize Work:** Tasks are represented on a Kanban board, divided into columns that represent different stages of the workflow (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").
2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP):** A maximum number of tasks is set that can be worked on simultaneously in a phase to avoid overload and improve focus.
3. **Focus on Flow:** The goal is to continuously improve the workflow and identify and eliminate bottlenecks.
4. **Continuous Improvement:** Teams regularly analyze their processes and look for optimization opportunities.

### **Benefits of Kanban:**

- **Transparency:** All team members have a clear overview of the current status of tasks.
- **Flexibility:** Kanban allows for quick responses to changes and adjustments to priorities.
- **Efficiency:** Limiting work in progress increases productivity and helps identify bottlenecks faster.
- **Improved Collaboration:** The visual representation promotes communication and collaboration within the team.

### **How Does a Kanban Board Work?**

A typical Kanban board consists of several columns representing the workflow. Each task is noted on a card and moves through the different stages until it is completed. Here is a simple example:

| To Do      | In Progress | Done     |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Task 1     | Task 2      | Task 3   |
| Task 4     |             | Task 5   |
